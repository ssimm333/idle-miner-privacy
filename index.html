    <h1>Idle Miner – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: February 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Idle Miner ("the game") is a free-to-play idle game      
  developed by an independent developer. This policy explains   
  what data is collected and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally     
  identifiable information. All game progress (balance,
  upgrades, achievements) is saved locally on your device only  
  using Android's SharedPreferences storage.</p>

    <h2>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>The game displays rewarded video ads provided by Google  
  AdMob. Google may collect device identifiers and usage data to
   serve personalised ads. You can opt out of personalised      
  advertising in your device settings under <em>Google → Ads →  
  Opt out of Ads Personalisation</em>. Google's privacy policy  
  is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

  We do not receive or store your payment information. Google   
  Play's terms apply.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>

  offline earnings. These notifications are generated on-device 
  and no data is transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The game is not directed at children under the age of 13.
   We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
